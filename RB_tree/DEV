NOTES TO DEVELOPERS USING RBT_implementation:

> currently only supports insert, remove, and search
  > need to update so that supports in-order traversal and the like

> currently doesn't allow duplicate keys

> currently handles fixes slightly recursively
  > should be fairly straightforward to make more iterative by cutting and pasting code from different cases
