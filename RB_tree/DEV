NOTES TO DEVELOPERS USING RBT_implementation:

> MAKE SURE CHANGE SUCC AND PRED WHEN DELETING!!

> currently one copy of the file can only produce one "type" of tree; i.e. a "my_type" can only be one type
  > need to change what is stored/returned to void * when entirely sure tree is working correctly so can support different types without copying entire file and changing "my_type"

> caching for LRU and/or LFU?

> currently only supports insert, remove, and search
  > need to update so that supports in-order traversal and the like

> currently doesn't allow duplicate keys
  > ??? this normal in RB trees ???

> currently handles fixes slightly recursively
  > ??? should be fairly straightforward to make more iterative by cutting and pasting code from different cases ???
