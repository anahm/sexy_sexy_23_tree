=================

ohai - this is Neilix

trying to practice writing different tree structures (for the lulz)

> vector (array that resizes) 	     // basic implementation done

> red-black tree	   	     // working on it

> skip list 			     // pretty sweet; might be fun to have a working implementation around
     				     if the balanced trees start to annoy us

> hash list			     // Yaniv's implementation of linked list



> 2-3 tree  			     // meh (already working on balanced tree)

> b tree (files that users store)    // meh (already working on balanced tree)

> hashtable     	   	     // Yaniv

> trie				     // srsly?
