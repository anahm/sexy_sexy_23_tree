DEV NOTES FOR SEXY_LOVER_VECTOR(E)

GENERAL NOTES 

> designed to work on structs; assumes the structs are malloc'ed by the user; free'ing taken care of by free_vectore

> get_last_used_index not currently used in code; more intended to be used by client so as not to waste time searching for data when couldn't be there

DESIGN DECISIONS

> container has an array of my_type *'s instead of my_type's


PROBLEMS/TODO

> resize only upscales by factor of 2
  > wasteful if have, for instance, only 1 really high index

> no way to downscale vector
  > wasteful if had lots of high-index values but don't anymore

> wanted a self-resizing vectore class; add uses realloc, meaning add has to return a pointer to the new vectore; returns NULL in a variety of error conditions
  > should clarify why failed (possibly using perror?)
